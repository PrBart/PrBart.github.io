## Professional Summary

**Senior Full-Stack Developer with 8+ years of experience** building, scaling, and maintaining a wide range of production web applications and software solutions. I specialize in **React and Next.js**, designing scalable frontend architectures, performant user interfaces, and clean, maintainable code.
Alongside frontend development, I have strong hands-on experience with **Node.js**. I am comfortable owning features end-to-end — from requirements and architecture to deployment, performance optimization, and CI/CD.

I regularly use **AI-assisted development tools (LLMs)** to speed up development, improve code quality, testing, and documentation, while keeping full ownership of technical outcomes.
